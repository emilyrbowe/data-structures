# Final Project Documentation for Assignments 1, 2, and 3

For the final assignments in Data Structures Fall 2020, I worked on three projects. Collectively, they were run by an Express.JS app and displayed different skills related to scraping, cleaning, sensing, storing, and displaying both structured and undstructured data.

Final Project 1: [Manhattan Alcoholics Anonymous Meetings Map](AA_README.md)

Final Project 2: [Thesis Writing Process Blog](Process_README.md)

Final Project 3: [Temperature Sensor Interface](Temp_README.md)
