## Objective: Finish parsing AA data & geocode data before adding it to a PostgresSQL DB

In this assignment, I was asked to finish parsing the data for my assigned zone by getting all relevant data values. I also was tasked with repeating this process for the nine other zones. From there, I had to geocode the address data to then be able to add it to a PostgresSQL DB.
